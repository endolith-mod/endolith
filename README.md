# Endolith

*Endolith is still very early in development. It does not yet have any published release.*

A Minecraft Java Edition mod adding:

* **The Endolith**: A new type of End City built into, around, and below End Islands, containing alien technologies, foundries, and treasures
* **Void Flux**: Harness a new form of energy by smashing different materials together in increasingly massive Void Accelerator machines
* **Endolithic Technology**: Use your newfound mastery of Void Flux to power the foundries, vehicles, and equipment learned (or stolen!) from the Endolith
